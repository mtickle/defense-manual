# Introduction: The Enemy at the Back Door

In September 2025, I was ordained as a deacon in my church. It was an emotional service; I stood before the congregation, gave my testimony, and felt the weight of hands laid upon me in prayer. I was a musician, a youth leader, and now a deacon. I felt like my walk with God was about to reach new heights.

It was only a matter of days before the bottom fell out.

It started with "normal" life problems—thousands of dollars in car repairs, a flat tire in a distant city, financial strain, and family tension. But it quickly morphed into something darker: raw, intense anxiety. I felt physically sick, seized by hot flashes of panic and an urge to run for the hills.

The anxiety became so blinding and burning that I couldn't see a way out. It was literally taking the breath out of me. I eventually found myself planning my own death. I wrote a note to my family—a note my wife eventually found—and I stood on the precipice of total collapse.

## The Library Moment

Several weeks later, I was sitting in a public library, staring at a laptop, pretending to work but actually paralyzed by fear. That is when God finally broke through the noise. He spoke a simple truth to my heart: *You do not have to go through this alone.*

I realized two things in that moment:

1.  I had the ultimate toolkit right in front of me: **The Bible**.
2.  I was **under attack**.

I realized that my anxiety wasn't just bad luck; it was the Enemy. The Bible tells us that when we draw closer to God, the Devil will do anything to stop us. I had just committed my life to service, and the Devil was furious. I had been spiritually lax, leaving the "back door" open, and he had walked right in.

## Building the Defense Protocols

I needed a weapon. I didn't need a heavy theological textbook I had to read for hours; I needed a flashcard. I needed something I could pull up on my phone in the middle of a panic attack that would tell me exactly what to do.

So, I got to work. Using the Bible as my foundation—and yes, utilizing modern AI tools to help me organize and research theological concepts—I built a "Defense Protocol."

I wanted a system that was simple:

* **A Verse:** The weapon from Scripture.
* **The Trigger:** Identifying the attack.
* **My Action:** What to do physically and spiritually.
* **My Goal:** The specific outcome I needed to reach.

## How to Use This Guide

This book is the result of that work. It is a collection of the protocols I built to save my own life and sanity. We will cover seven different defense protocols, ranging from anxiety to sudden storms to depression, and finally, to seal our rejection of the Enemy among us, spiritual overflow—learning to live so full of God that the Enemy cannot find a foothold.

:::info Disclosure
I am neither a theologian nor a counsellor. I am merely a believer in my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and a believer in the power of prayer. My theology game is admittedly weak at times. I used tools to help me build this, but every word has been prayed over and vetted against Scripture.

This is not a magic cure. Consider it a stepping stone. It is a **field manual** for when you feel the fire burning and the Devil reaching out to touch you.
